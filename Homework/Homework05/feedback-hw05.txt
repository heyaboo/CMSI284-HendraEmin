TOTAL EARNED POINTS:
   you earned 91/100 which is 91.00% which is an A-minus

========================================================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

First things first: please put your source code files into separate files,
so that I can compile and run them.  I had to separate them into files, as
you can see by the extra files that are now in your repo.

In wordcount.c you had two different variables, "wordCount" and "words" that
were referring to the count of words in the file.  This was causing the file
not to compile.  I fixed those for you.

Everything now compiles.

For problem 1, you are supposed to output 32 bits, which should be padded
with leading zeros if necessary.  You only output the number of bits which
runs to the most significant "1" bit.  You also don't error check the input;
when I enter "asdf" you convert that to "10010" instead of displaying an
error message.

For problem 2, you were supposed to take either a "32" or a "64" from the
command line and display the proper number of zero-filled hexadecimal digits
based on that.  If nothing was input the default should have been "32".  You
never handle the 64-bit values, or the command line at all.  In addition,
still no error checking ~ "asdf" is converted to "0x0000" with no error.

The timesTables doesn't work quite right.  It was supposed to output a table
of values that would be from 2 to "N" in both directions, with the "N" from
the command line.  However, the specification wasn't really clear, so full
credit earned.

Problems 4 and 5 work perfectly!

========================================================
SEMESTER SCORE SO FAR:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework03 ~  86.96% of  5 points =  4.35 points
   homework04 ~  92.22% of  5 points =  4.61 points
   homework05 ~  91.00% of 10 points =  9.10 points
                                total: 28.06 out of 30.00 =  93.53%
                                which is an A

VERY VERY good work!
