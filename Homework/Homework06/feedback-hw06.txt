TOTAL EARNED POINTS:
   you earned 44.00/100.00 which is 44% which is not your best work...

========================================================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

Problem #1 didn't assemble at first.  You forgot the underscores in front of
   the calls to "_printf" and "_scanf".  I fixed those for you and now it is
   in good shape.  Full credit earned.

Problem #2 your "C" code compiles fine by itself, but it doesn't call any
   "nasm" function.  The way your code is structured, there is not a function
   in your nasm code for gcd since it is a "main" program.  You need a second
   nasm file with just the functin in it, as is specified by the problem text.
   You earn partial credit for the "C" file.

Problem #3, there were several minor problems here.  You need a "global" at the
   top of the file that specifies the "_main" for this program.  Then you need
   an "extern" right after that to declare the "_printf" function you'll call
   from the "C" library.  Then there was a missign comma at line 26.  I added
   all that for you and now it assembles and runs just fine.  Full credit is
   earned for this one.

Problem #4 works perfectly.

Problem #5 you seem to be missing the "makeNBOC.c" and "makeNBOCtest.c" files
   which are required for this problem.  Hmmmm...

Problem #6, without the function file from problem #5, not much to do here.
   The file you DID put here doesn't assemble.

========================================================
SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework03 ~  86.96% of  5 points =  4.35 points
   homework04 ~  92.22% of  5 points =  4.61 points
   homework05 ~  91.00% of 10 points =  9.10 points
   homework06 ~  44.00% of 15 points =  6.60 points
                       semester total: 34.66 out of 45.00 = 77.02%
                             which is a C

This was a difficult assignment, and you did pretty well on it.
